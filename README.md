# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using CNN

## Overview

This project is part of **Task 03** of my **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship**.  
The objective of this task is to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## Problem Statement

The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.  
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately **classify an input image as either a cat or a dog**.

This task focuses on understanding how deep learning models process visual data and how convolutional layers extract meaningful features from images.
